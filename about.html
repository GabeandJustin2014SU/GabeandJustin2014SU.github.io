        <h1>Our Background</h1>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">
<br>Drawing upon his leadership experience in the <i>New York State High School Democrats</i>, the <i>Community Free Democrats</i>, the <i>Stuyvesant Young Democrats</i>, the <i>Manhattan Young Democrats</i>, as well as his community service experiences in the <i>New York City Council and Manhattan Community Boards</i>, <b>Gabriel Rosen</b> wishes to serve the Stuyvesant Community as its Student Union President in order to revitalize the democratic character of the student government and transform the Student Union into an aegis for student rights and the heart of a stronger Stuyvesant community. 
<br>Gabriel's running-mate <b>Justin Kong</b> is a staunch advocate for student rights, serving on the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Stuyvesant Environmental club</i>. Who knows, from first-hand experience by undertaking community service endeavors in Peru, unifying together as one community will provide all Stuyvesant students with the tools they need to achieve success both in High School and in their futures. 
<p class="lead">
<br>Thus, we aim to usher in a new era in the governance of this school - one defined by an atmosphere of unity and a reverence for democratic ideals.
