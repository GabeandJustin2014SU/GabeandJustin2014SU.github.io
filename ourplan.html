        <h1>Our objectives:</h1>
        <p class="lead"><br><b>The Homeroom Board Senate</b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">
<br>Drawing upon our extensive experience working in tandem with local government, we aim to recreate New York City’s Community Board system within the Stuyvesant Student Union through the creation of the “Homeroom Board Senate”.
<br>The Homeroom Boards, much like the Community Boards across New York City, will be pivotal in instilling a sense of civic duty and school pride throughout the Stuyvesant student body, and will work to enhance and preserve the character of the school’s many unique communities.
Furthermore, just as Community Boards throughout the city have improved the lives of all New Yorkers through democratic initiatives, so too will Homeroom Boards ensure that all Stuyvesant students have their voices heard in the governance of their school – thus turning the Student Union into a true force for change.
<p class="lead"><br><b>The Congress of Student Organizations</b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">
<br>Drawing further upon extensive experience with New York City political organizations and Stuyvesant clubs/pubs, we hereby aim to further unify the student body through the formation of “The Congress of Student Organizations.”
<br>The CSO, much like the representative bodies that today provide invaluable support to millions of New Yorkers, will provide the democratic tools with which all Stuyvesant Organizations shall achieve greater representation in the governance of their school and greater access to those resources necessary for their success.
Furthermore, the CSO will facilitate the formation of unprecedentedly robust bonds between all student organizations in the school, consequently forging a stronger sense of school pride throughout the student populace.
<p class="lead"><br><b>General Governmental Practices:</b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align:left">
<br>Drawing upon our observations of good governance throughout New York City, we hereby aim to undertake the duties prescribed in the Student Union Constitution to the best of our abilities and will utilize all resources at our disposal to ensure that any and all needs of the student body be addressed in a manner most conducive to its interests.
<br>Our pledge to the student populace is predicated on a trust in the virtues of democratic governance and the opportunities that a free society provides – we hence view our political initiatives as the keys to a brighter future for this school.
With the unprecedented opportunities for governmental input that the CSO and the HBS will provide, we are confident that under our leadership the Stuyvesant community will unite together to light the way toward an even brighter future for all.
We thus humbly ask for your support come June 10th, so that we may all enjoy a “New Era, a New SU, and a New Stuyvesant for me and you!”
